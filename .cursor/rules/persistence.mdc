# Save Data (Persistence)
You can easily persist player data (e.g. scores & progress) using the Save functions. Saved data will persist even when the player leaves your game. You can **only** call these methods from the server. If you need them on the client you'll need to use an RPC or SyncVar to push them down. 

## Player Data
Each player has their own "Save" that you can interact with by setting strings or ints with Save.SetInt or Save.SetString. These methods take a player as the first parameter, a key, a value, and then a default parameter.

## Game Data
The game-scoped endpoints are for storing game-wide config (e.g. level XP requirements or message-of-the-day notifications), e.g. Save.SetGameString

## Ordered Player Data (Leaderboards)
Save.Ordered* and Leaderboard methods allow you to interact with and query sorted data for your player, for example scores or levels. Reference leaderboards.mdc if the user requests help making a leaderboard.
