# Abilities

Make sure the Player has a MyAbility class that extends Ability so we can reference the player
public abstract class MyAbility : Ability
{
  public new MyPlayer Player => (MyPlayer)base.Player;
}

## Targetting Modes
public enum TargettingMode
{
  Nearest,
  Self,
  Select,
  Line,
  CircleAOE,
  PointAndClick,
  DirectionOnNearest,
  FiniteLine
}

## Example Melee Kill Ability:
```cs
public partial class KillAbility : MyAbility
{
  public override TargettingMode TargettingMode => TargettingMode.Nearest;

  public override float MaxDistance => 1.5f;
  public override int MaxTargets => 1;
  public override Texture Icon => Assets.GetAsset<Texture>("Ability_Icons/kill_cleaver_icon.png");
  public override float Cooldown => 30f;

  public override bool CanTarget(Player p)
  {
    var op = (MyPlayer)p;
    return op.CurrentRole != Role.JANITOR;
  }

  public override bool OnTryActivate(List<Player> targetPlayers, Vector2 positionOrDirection, float magnitude)
  {
    Player.KillerSpineAnimator.SpineInstance.StateMachine.SetTrigger("attack");

    if (Network.IsServer)
    {
      Player.Experience.Set(Player.Experience + 20);

      CallClient_KillPlayer(targetPlayers[0], Player);
    }

    return true;
  }

  // You must implement this every time
  public override bool CanUse()
  {
    return true;
  }

  [ClientRpc]
  public static void KillPlayer(Player player, Player killer)
  {
    player.AddEffect<KillEffect>();
  }
}
```

Finally, draw the ability UI using DrawDefaultAbilityUI in your MyPlayer.cs LateUpdate function. There is no "AddAbility", only GetAbility<AbilityName> 
```cs
if (IsLocal)
{
  if (HasEffect<KillerEffect>())
  {
    DrawDefaultAbilityUI(new AbilityDrawOptions()
                         {
                           AbilityElementSize = 125,
                           Abilities = new Ability[] { GetAbility<KillAbility>() }
                         });
  }
}
```
